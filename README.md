# 🧠 Brain-Age Prediction Challenge
The challenge is to predict chronological age of cognitively healthy adults using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), applied to FreeSurfer-derived Structural MRI features from OASIS-3 dataset.

* **Task:** Regression
* **Target:** `age_at_visit` (in years)
* **Primary Metric:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset is curated from the **OASIS-3** longitudinal cohort. To ensure a pure aging baseline, we selected individuals who remained cognitively normal at all available visits (no MCI or dementia diagnoses).

* **Cohort:** 288 subjects (431 total sessions).
* **Preprocessing:** MRI scans were processed via the [FreeSurfer Pipeline](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). Processed data were sourced from the [Neuroimaging Informatics Tools and Resources Clearinghouse (NITRC)](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/oasis3) repository. For simplicity, this challenge focuses exclusively on cortical measures (excluding subcortical and other regions). **Desikan-Killiany atlas** was used for cortical parcellation, which defines 68 cortical regions (34 per hemisphere).
* **Structural Features:** For each of the 68 cortical regions, two primary morphological metric is provided: **Cortical Thickness (mm)** and **Cortical Gray Matter Volume (mm³)**.
* **Structural Connectomes:** Connectivity data (adjacency matrices) were sourced from [BrainGraph.org](https://braingraph.org/cms/), generated by the **PIT Bioinformatics Group**. The adjacency matrix for each 431 subject scans are provided. Steps to extract the adjacency matrix of each subject/sessions is described below.

## ⚙️ Graph Specifications
Each MRI session is represented as a graph:

* **Nodes ($N=68$):** Representing the 68 cortical regions.
* **Node Features:** A 2D vector per region:
    1.  **Cortical Thickness** (mm)
    2.  **Gray Matter Volume** (mm³)
    * *Total Features:* 68 nodes $\times$ 2 metrics = 136 structural features per graph.
* **Edges:** Weighted by **dMRI Streamline Counts** (Fiber Counts) between regions. Adjacency matrices are provided for each session.
* **Target:** Scalar **Age at Visit** (in years)

```


The dataset (431 total sessions) is split approximately into **80% Training**, **10% Validation**, and **10% Testing**. The split was performed at the **subject level** (ensuring no subject appears in more than one set) and was **stratified by age** to ensure a balanced distribution across all subsets.

* **`data/public/train_data.csv`**: 
  Contains data for 230 patients (353 sessions). Each row represents one MRI session.
  * **Subject**: Unique identifier for the participant.
  * **MR_session**: Unique identifier for the specific scan session.
  * **age_at_visit**: The target variable (chronological age in years).
  * **136 Cortical Measures**: Volume and thickness metrics for the 68 cortical regions.

* **`data/public/val_data.csv`**: 
  Contains 29 patients (39 sessions) for validation. Follows the same structure as the training set.

* **`data/public/test_data.csv`**: 
  Contains 29 patients (39 sessions). The target column (`age_at_visit`) is omitted.

* **`data/public/adjacency_matrices/`**: 
  A directory containing the 68x68 structural connectivity matrices for every session in the dataset.

## 📥 Loading the Adjacency Matrices
The adjacency matrices are provided as CSV files under `data/public/adjacency_matrices/`. Each file is named by its Session ID (e.g., `OAS30001_d0757.csv`). You can load them as follows:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load a specific session's adjacency matrix
file_path = 'data/public/adjacency_matrices/OAS30001_d0757.csv'
adj_df = pd.read_csv(file_path, index_col=0)

# The matrix is 68x68, where rows/cols match the order of regions in train_data.csv
print(adj_df.shape)  # Output: (68, 68)

```

## 📝 Submission Instructions
To protect your model strategy and ensure a fair competition, all submissions must be **encrypted** before being uploaded to GitHub.

### 1. Prepare Your Results

Generate a `predictions.csv` file with **exactly two columns**:

- `subject_session`
- `age_at_visit`

> **Note:** `subject_session` is the concatenation of the `Subject` and `MR_session` values from `test_data.csv`  
> Example: `Test_Sub_001-Sess_01`

#### 📄 Sample Format for `predictions.csv`

| subject_session        | age_at_visit |
| :--------------------- | :----------- |
| Test_Sub_001-Sess_01   | 66.03828     |
| Test_Sub_001-Sess_02   | 66.35320     |
| Test_Sub_002-Sess_01   | 63.15323     |

> 💡 A template is provided at: `data/public/sample_submission.csv`

### 2. Install Encryption Dependencies
Ensure you have the required cryptography library installed in your local environment:
```bash
pip install pycryptodome pandas
```

### 3. Encrypt Your Submission
You must use the provided public key keys/public_key.pem to encrypt your results. Run the encryption script as follows:
```bash
    python submissions/encrypt_submission.py \
        --input path/to/your/predictions.csv \
        --key keys/public_key.pem \
        --output submissions/<your_team_name>/predictions.enc
```
   This will generate an encrypted file ```predictions.enc```

### 5. Submit via Pull Request
1. **Fork** this repository.
2. **Create a folder** named after your team: `submissions/<your_team_name>/`.
3. **Upload** exactly two files:
    * `predictions.enc` (The encrypted file you generated)
    * `metadata.json`
4. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**.
   
### 6. Automated Scoring
* Wait ~1-2 minutes. Bot will use a securely stored private key to decrypt and score your submission.
* The bot will calculate your **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and post it as a comment directly on your PR!
* Once your PR is merged, your results will be officially added to the leaderboard.
